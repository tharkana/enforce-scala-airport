aalborg-airport,/airport-reviews/aalborg-airport,Aalborg Airport customer review,Klaus Malling,Denmark,2014-02-11,"A small very effective airport with few flights. Check-in is notorious quick and staff friendly arrival very quick and busses to Aalborg frequent. Usually no problems getting taxis as well. There used to be a cafeteria but nowadays just a kiosk - but good cafeteria with reasonable prizes inside terminal. Security check quick and friendly as well. There is a nice viewing pavilion at one end of the airport. Outside note the famous ""kiss and goodbye signs"". Restrooms outside terminal however few.",,,,9.0,5.0,5.0,,,,4.0,,,1
aalborg-airport,/airport-reviews/aalborg-airport,Aalborg Airport customer review,S Kroes,Netherlands,2013-02-13,This is a nice and modern airport at the moment they are expanding the airport so there is a lot of building going on but in the departure area you will not notice this very much. The Airport has got free Wifi and a small restaurant with shop on the land side. Airside you will find a small shop with pre-packed sandwiches and hot dogs and other small stuff a small duty free shop is also around but not very cheap. There is no Lounge to be found at the moment but after the expansion is completed there will be one available (around May 2013). Check-in procedures are fast and the waiting area after check-in is fine with a view on the tarmac. All in all a nice modern but small airport with expensive restaurants and shop.,,,,9.0,5.0,4.0,,,,4.0,,,1
aalborg-airport,/airport-reviews/aalborg-airport,Aalborg Airport customer review,M Andersen,Denmark,2012-08-07,A very nice airy terminal - that seems modern enough. Free WIFI and free parking. Everything within walking distance. Most people travel domestic to Copenhagen but a rising number of international routes e.g. AAL-AMS makes for a lot of possibilities. Check-in is very quick and so is Security. All in all a nice experience.,,,,9.0,5.0,5.0,,,,4.0,,,1
aalborg-airport,/airport-reviews/aalborg-airport,Aalborg Airport customer review,Paul Van Alsten,France,2011-05-22,AMS-AAL and quite satisfied with this regional airport. Only a few flights per day so baggage reclaim understandably very quick. Bus line 2 connects with downtown Aalborg every 15 minutes weekdays but only hourly during the weekend - travel time is 15 mins and costs 18DKK. Check-in efficient and hassle-free using self-service kiosks. Free Internet computers are available landside - a nice touch. Security staff very friendly. Boarding area is rather cramped with limited seating - do not go airside too early.,,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,3.0,,,0
aalborg-airport,/airport-reviews/aalborg-airport,Aalborg Airport customer review,K Fischer,,2010-08-04,Very quick check-inn and security screening. Nice and airy. Free parking! No need to show up at the airport very early as is the case in CPH. Only drawback is that after security you will be standing and waiting for the gate to open. There is is very little space here and no where to sit down.,,,,4.0,,,,,,,,,0
aalborg-airport,/airport-reviews/aalborg-airport,Aalborg Airport customer review,M Larsen,,2009-03-26,Aalborg Lufthavn (AAL) is a smallish airport near the city of Aalborg. There is not usually a lot of people leaving or arriving at any one time so there is hardly ever any time wasted standing in line for check-in or security checks - brilliant! A very friendly and inviting atmosphere overall.,,,,5.0,,,,,,,,,0
aalborg-airport,/airport-reviews/aalborg-airport,Aalborg Airport customer review,J Plum,,2008-06-12,Nice big cafe on first floor with great view Overall very bright free access to computers for checking mails etc while waiting.

aalborg-airport,/airport-reviews/aalborg-airport,Aalborg Airport customer review,P Panagopoulos,,2008-06-10,It's a depressing airport in a depressing town! SAS and Maersk are the only operators using it besides a few private owners and charter airlines. Use it only if you have to! If there's no taxi waiting outside it is difficult to go to the city centre. The only reason this airport exists is to serve passengers who fly abroad especially via CPH.,,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,0
aalborg-airport,/airport-reviews/aalborg-airport,Aalborg Airport customer review,Pedro Gil,,2005-08-28,Amazed to find that this little place gets reviews! I staged through here in April 05 enroute to LHR via CPH. Very bright clean and well designed airport. Good little cafe with interesting local food. All very efficient when I went through.,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
aalborg-airport,/airport-reviews/aalborg-airport,Aalborg Airport customer review,Kent C Cooper,,2004-02-17,I've been travelling through this airport every week for more than two years. Very easy access (12 min. from downtown Aalborg) right up to main entrance. SAS is really the only game in town once you get in and be prepared for delays on flights to/from Copenhagen (a 35-min. flight). Extremely clean as is the Danish way. Ground staff and crews are helpful enough but to any seasoned traveller this is a backwater airport. Again the SAS AAL-CPH-AAL leg is notorious for delays each week so if you have connecting flights out of CPH plan accordingly. Also upon arrival at AAL there are not always enough taxis waiting outside and you might have to wait a few minutes. Buses run into town on a regular basis but everthing at this small airport - taxis buses kiosk opening hours etc. - are all timed to coincide with arrivals and departures of flights from CPH.,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
aarhus-airport,/airport-reviews/aarhus-airport,Aarhus Airport customer review,Paul Hastie,,2004-11-29,Nice small friendly airport. Good transport links to the city by bus which meets flights and plenty of taxis. A few shops and cafes and very clean facilities.,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
aberdeen-airport,/airport-reviews/aberdeen-airport,Aberdeen Airport customer review,John Murphy,United Kingdom,2015-07-21,This airport gets worse on a monthly basis. They have spent 3 million pounds on a new front door when it needs bigger and up to date security. Anymore than one plane makes the queue terrible. Arrivals is so small you queue outside if you are sat at the back of the plane and then wait for the smallest baggage belt I have ever seen (I travel every week). It is by far the poorest airport I have had the unfortunate pleasure to use. I recommend using Edinburgh and commuting!,Arrival and Departure,21-06-2015,Business,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,2.0,1.0,2.0,,0
aberdeen-airport,/airport-reviews/aberdeen-airport,Aberdeen Airport customer review,M Cristea,Romania,2015-06-24,"Small airport, our arrival was on Saturday, June 13, 10:30 PM. Unfortunately, there were three planes landed at the same time approx, and ours was the third, So we had to wait in lane in a crowded tiny corridor for frontier controls, but staff was efficient. Than we stayed in lane to get a taxi to reach city center for 45 mins. Departure was on Monday, June 22, at 12:10 PM, much better, smooth drop-off and security controls, no problem. Limited offer for eat/ drink and shopping, not overpriced, The Granite-City Restaurant in the main hall seemed to be OK!",Arrival and Departure,24-06-2015,FamilyLeisure,8.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,,2.0,3.0,2.0,,1
aberdeen-airport,/airport-reviews/aberdeen-airport,Aberdeen Airport customer review,P Reid,United Arab Emirates,2015-04-01,"I've been coming through Aberdeen airport for a few years now and can't figure out how they can be so lethargic in making drastically-needed changes to improve passenger experience except of course where it can make them money like the new drop-off charge! Flew in last week from Amsterdam and used the Arrivals toilet which was more like a construction site portaloo cabin; cramped and unpleasant not a great welcome for visitors. Then leaving on an early flight on Saturday no food or drink facilities open landside queued for over 20mins to go through the security scanner (note this was at 5am for only the 2nd flight of the day) to find only 1 scanner in operation. Made it through for final boarding call so no breakfast for me! They really are kidding themselves calling it an international airport for the ""Oil capital of Europe"". I know many Aberdonians are ashamed of their airport and justifiably so.",,,,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,,2.0,,,0
aberdeen-airport,/airport-reviews/aberdeen-airport,Aberdeen Airport customer review,M Stewart,United Kingdom,2015-03-24,Airport is small and convenient when flights can actually leave and the check in and security I experienced were fine. The airport lounges are OK too if you are frequent flyer. However the airport is not equipped for all weather flights apparently the runway is too short so delays or cancellations due to weather (a little bit of fog) occur as happened the only 2 times I visited and I understand this is not infrequent. A taxi driver who took me to a hotel (which I paid for myself) told me that when delays occur all the local hotels are full so I had to find a hotel way out of Aberdeen. The positive side for taxi drivers is that the one who took me said he'd had a passenger who was so desperate to get to Heathrow he paid Â£1000 (yes one thousand GBP) to get there. They staff at BA with whom I'd flown are unable to cope with queues very long at desks. Its more like a third world airport in that respect. One would have thought that with the importance of the oil industry etc that arrangements would have been made to improve capacity and capability.,,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,,,,3.0,,,0
aberdeen-airport,/airport-reviews/aberdeen-airport,Aberdeen Airport customer review,B Biscuit,United Kingdom,2014-12-21,"Aberdeen is my local airport for 40 years and has grown from a quaint airfield to a merely adequate airport. Facilities are only ok you don't want to be hanging around any longer than strictly necessary. The food (you can't call it dining) options are very poor and very expensive by any airport standard. Then the transport links which are a whole subject on their own but the next bit is typical. If you have a late flight don't rely on getting a taxi as the drivers tend to just go home when they've made enough money to go golfing. Also don't ask them to go too far more than 15 miles into the country as that is too much bother for them and they will turf you out of their car even at 23.30hrs. If you can get basic civility from them then you're lucky. Opening the boot for you is a special treat. £16 for about 7 miles is the fare but they will take £20 from you. The 727 bus is fine but you can have a half hour wait in the freezing ""shelter"" and it only runs to the city centre and ends at 22.30(?). Long term (more than a day) off site parking is really your best/only option. Aberdeen where they built the terminal on the opposite side of the airport to the train station to give taxi drivers a job.",,,,2.0,3.0,3.0,,,,2.0,,,0
